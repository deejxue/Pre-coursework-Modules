I think for me, the hardest parts will probably be the planning.  When I plan, I'm really good at what I do.  But I am sometimes impatient to get the results I want so I have skipped the planning stage at times thinking I can quickly resolve the matter.  Sometimes this has worked for me as I get a quick general plan in my mind.  I generally do a lot of Googling looking for keywords that lead me to figuring out what will work and try many avenues until I find what I'm looking for.  However, when the matter can not be resolved that simply, I need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a real plan and write down what I've tried up til that point.  Then I can usually come up with a working solution to my problem.
